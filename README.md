There's no secret that major corporations are responsible for their drastic contributions to accelerating climate change. As a result, many people tend to believe that they cannot help mitigate their own contributions. However, there are many actions that individuals can take to create a greener Planet Earth.

At Swift Sustainability, we believe everybody deserves easy access to sustainability tools. We have designed our website to contain three useful elements: a recycling classifier, recipes to prevent food waste, and a carbon footprint calculator. With these tools, anybody can educate themselves on proper recycling techniques, food waste prevention, and smarter lifestyle choices, that will all positively contribute to the environment.
